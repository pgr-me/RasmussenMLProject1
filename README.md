# Peter Rasmussen, Programming Assignment 2

This ```README``` serves as an informational entry point into the Python module pa2. **Please note
a more detailed, module-level ```README``` is available in the ```pa2/``` directory. The more
detailed README provides information about how to run the program, features of the modules, inputs
and outputs, an example output file, and licensing.**

## Lab Structure

* ```pa2/``` Python module selects the longest interweaving, if it exists, of x and y in s.
* ```analysis/``` PDF of pseudo code of the algorithms used by the ```pa2``` module plus analysis
  of runtime complexity and a comparison between the pseudo code and the implemented algorithms.
  Includes reflection on lessons learned.
* ```resources/``` Provides default output datasets and echoed inputs.
